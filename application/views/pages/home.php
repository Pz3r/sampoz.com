  <h2>Hello, world! I'm a freelance software engineer...</h2>
  <p>
    If you're looking to build a shiny new application from the ground up, pretty up your current website or take your software system a notch higher I'd love to collaborate with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 10 years' experience as a software architect and developer I have designed and implemented back end and front end systems using various web and mobile technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently living in Mexico with my SO and our 2 <a href="https://imgur.com/BFp5txZ" target="_blank">cats</a>. I'm fluent in english and a native spanish speaker. I'm really into computer privacy and protection, cinema and board games.

  <em><h3>A little more about me</h3></em>
  <p>
    I'm a "full stack" software developer, meaning I know my way about several back end and front end technologies.

  <p>
    I enjoy working with <span class="special">Javascript</span>, <span class="special">Node.js</span>, <span class="special">React Native</span>, <span class="special">GraphQL</span>, <span class="special">Java</span>, and the <span class="special">Android SDK</span>. I'm experienced in both SQL and NoSQL database technologies and have worked with services such as <span class="special">AWS AppSync</span> and <span class="special">Cognito</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've dabbled in other languages and frameworks such as as <span class="special">Python</span>, <span class="special">Django</span>, <span class="special">PHP</span>, <span class="special">Symfony</span> <span class="special">CodeIgniter</span> and <span class="special">CSS</span>.
